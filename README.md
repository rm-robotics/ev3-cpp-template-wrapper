# ARCHIVE NOTICE
Since the EV3 bricks are now being replaced by new Spike Prime bricks and the original developers (Eisverygoodletter, txxvgnx, NotOnAClient) have graduated and left the robotics club. This repository no longer has an active maintainer and will be archived.

This repository will still remain available and all of its functionality will be intact, but no new features would be added unless a new maintainer is willing to implement features. If you are interested in using this repository or contributing to it, contact me (Eisverygoodletter) at yuetlongfeng@gmail.com

# welcome to `ev3dev-cpp-template-wrapper`'s repository page.
This library doesn't require excessive tool installation and overly complicated cross-compiler setups. A guide can be found [here](https://rshs-robotics-club.github.io/ev3wrap/master/)
### This is a wrapper around [ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp](https://github.com/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp). It includes classes for different sensors, with support for:
-   Building Block Robotics IR Seeker
-   Ev3 brick buttons
-   Color Sensors
-   Gyro Sensors
-   HiTechnic Compass Sensors
-   HiTechnic IR Seeker
-   Ev3 large and medium motors
-   An `Omni` class used for managing a specific motor setup
-   Ultrasonic Sensors
-   Beeping with ev3 speaker (and speaking words)
-   Class for `Vector` math
-   Bluetooth communication (both ev3-to-ev3 and ev3-to-computer are possible)

While cross compiling has only been tested on Windows, a Github Codespace
