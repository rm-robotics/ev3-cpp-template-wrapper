## Why is the documentation all over the place?
### Reasons:
1. Attempted a migration to gitlab but found out we can't host documentation there free, so we gave up
2. We're currently transitioning into V2 of the library, which has a new build structure (still same api tho), which means the build tutorials are out of date (even this document)
3. Nobody is updating the documentation and i'm stuck fixing linker errors
